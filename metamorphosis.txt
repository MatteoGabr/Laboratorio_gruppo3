Metamorphosis by Infinity Songs
I've never had a decent answer to a single question
I don't say my opinions too loud, I'm always second-guessin'
I can't take many chances, I just stick to what I'm best at
My personality, it lends to bad first impressions

What I'd give, to give it all I've got
What I'd do, to be something I'm not
Never blamed, to be so nonchalant
Now I'm stuck on autopilot

And sometimes I don't like myself, can I be someone else?
Someone who makes their dreams come true and drinks from wishing wells
Someone that they call lucky, and I never seem to fail
But sometimes, I don't like myself, can I be someone else?

What I'd give, to give it all I've got
What I'd do, to be something l'm not
Never blamed, to be so nonchalant
Now I'm stuck on autopilot

You didn't have the confidence, you couldn't see a way through it
But look at all the things you did and look at your metamorphosis
Finally, you've found your gift and now you're on a rocket ship
You're standing there on that stage, all because you had the faith
You're basking in the light of day, a resurrection on your grave
Like flowers in the breeze, you sway, but rooted in the dirt, you'll stay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Huh, uh-huh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh, huh-huh, huh-huh-huh, hey-hey, ooh

Metamorphosis by Infinity Songs
I've never had a decent answer to a single question
I don't say my opinions too loud, I'm always second-guessin'
I can't take many chances, I just stick to what I'm best at
My personality, it lends to bad first impressions

Cosa darei, per dare tutto quel che ho
Cosa farei, per essere cosa che non sono
Non sono mai stato incolpato di essere così disinvolto
Ora sono bloccato sul pilota automatico

And sometimes I don't like myself, can I be someone else?
Someone who makes their dreams come true and drinks from wishing wells
Someone that they call lucky, and I never seem to fail
But sometimes, I don't like myself, can I be someone else?

Ce que je donnerais, pour donner tout ce que j'ai
Ce que je ferais, pour être ce que je ne suis pas
Je n'ai jamais été blâmé, d'être si nonchalant
Maintenant je suis coincé sur le pilote automatique

You didn't have the confidence, you couldn't see a way through it
But look at all the things you did and look at your metamorphosis
Finally, you've found your gift and now you're on a rocket ship
You're standing there on that stage, all because you had the faith
You're basking in the light of day, a resurrection on your grave
Like flowers in the breeze, you sway, but rooted in the dirt, you'll stay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Huh, uh-huh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh, huh-huh, huh-huh-huh, hey-hey, ooh
